## Hi there 👋

My name is Giancarlo Bonvenuto and I love Low Level projects.

Currently I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Estate University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil.

I'm generally interested in Low Level Projects and Languages so feel free to contact me if you need help at a project. Though as you can see from my profile I'm still learning a lot.
