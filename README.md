## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Giancarlo Bonvenuto and I love Low Level projects.

Currently I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Estate University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil and act as the Coordinator of the Embedded Systems and Telemetry of [UNICAMP Baja SAE Team](https://www.instagram.com/bajaunicamp/).

I'm generally interested in Low Level Projects and Languages so feel free to contact me if you need help at a project. Though as you can see from my profile I'm still learning a lot.
